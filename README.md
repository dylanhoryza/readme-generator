## Description
- My motivation for this project was to be able to utilize and better understand Node.js 
- I built this project to generate a high quality README file.
- This application solves the problem of creating a README file in a fast and efficient way.
- I learned how to use the inquirer package and the require method in JavaScript to communicate with Node.js in the terminal.

## Installation
To install this project, open this index.js file in your integrated terminal. Type the command node index in the terminal to run the application.
You then will be prompted with several questions that will help fill out your README file. 
## Usage
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
   ```md
   ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
   ```
